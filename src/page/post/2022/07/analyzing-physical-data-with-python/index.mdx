One of the most time-consuming exercises I got to do throughout my
undergraduate physics program was taking laboratory measurements of various
physical phenomena and analyzing the measured datapoints to prove or
disprove certain mathematical model describing the measured phenomenon. The
university courses I undertook covered the required theory behind all carried
experiments in great detail, and reproducing these experiments was not a
problem. However, courses usually focus very little on the actual data
analysis, and, as such, students tend to resort to using inefficient data
processing methods or spend much more time researching and tinkering with
various data analysis tools instead of focusing on the problem at hand.

This blog post presents basic building blocks for writing your own data
analysis pipelines in the Python programming language. It contains a colorful
palette of ready-made code snippets with relevant examples of their physics
application. We'll cover all the necessary steps of a typical analysis
procedure, from loading your data into Python's virtual memory, through
performing statistical regressions, to visualizing your results and outputting
them into $\LaTeX$ documents.
