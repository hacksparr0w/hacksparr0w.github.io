    Exploring the most useful concepts, techniques, and packages for physical
    data analysis with the Python programming language

One of the most time-consuming exercises I got to do throughout my
undergraduate physics program was taking laboratory measurements of various
physical phenomena and analyzing the measured datapoints to prove or
disprove certain mathematical model describing the measured phenomenon. The
university courses I undertook covered the required theory behind all carried
experiments in great detail, and reproducing these experiments was not a
problem. However, courses usually focus very little on the actual data
analysis, and, as such, students tend to resort to using inefficient data
processing methods or spend much more time researching and tinkering with
various data analysis tools instead of focusing on the problem at hand.

This blog post presents basic building blocks for writing your own data
analysis scripts in the Python programming language. It contains a colorful
palette of ready-made code snippets with relevant examples of their physics
application. We'll cover all the necessary steps of a typical analysis
procedure, from loading your data into Python's virtual memory, through
performing statistical regressions, to visualizing your results and outputting
them into $\LaTeX$ documents.

It will probably take you some time before you come up with your own ideal
data analysis workflow, but I believe that by sharing some of the things I
discovered through numerous trials and errors, I can save you some headaches
and perhaps even make your time analyzing physical data a bit more enjoyable.

Please note that this is not meant to be a an introduction to Python
programming and I'll be asuming at least a little knowledge of Python's
syntax on your part. If this is your first encounter with Python, I'd highly
encourage you to read through the official [Python Documentation][1]. If you
are new to Python, you may still be able to learn a great deal just by playing
with the material shown here â€” Python is an incredibly intuitive programming
language and is made to be easily readable even for an untrained eye. Just try
copy-pasting the included examples into a Python REPL, modyfying them to your
curiosity's accords and see how far it gets you...

## Why Python?

The main difference between Python and other popular solutions for data
analysis, like, let's say, [qtiplot][1], is that Python is a proper programming
language. It is a program for making programs. As such, it is much more
powerful in its capabilities but also has a much steeper learning curve.

Although Python was originally not designed with scientific applications in
mind, its user-friendly language design and high-level nature made it very
appealing for scientists and engineers that aren't necessarily fluent in
low-level computing details and just want to get stuff done and iterate
quickly. Over the years Python has become extremely fashionable in the
scientific community and its vibrant ecosystem of packages for number
crunching and data visualization make it an excelent choice for data analysis
of any kind. To mention just one example out of many, the first-ever picture
of a black hole was [computationaly constructed using Python and Numpy][3].
